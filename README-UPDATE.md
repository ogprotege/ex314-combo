# Ex314.ai - A.I., Sanctified

![Ex314.ai Logo](public/chi-ro.png)

## Theology without confusion. Philosophy without fog.

Ex314.ai is a groundbreaking Catholic theological AI assistant built on a custom fine-tuned Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct model. Trained on the entire Code of Canon Law, the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Vatican II documents, and other authoritative Catholic texts, it aims to explain, illuminate, and defend the faith with clarity, reverence, patience, and compassion.

> Not built to replace the Magisterium, but to serve it, this is the first LLM fine-tuned for clarity, approachability, and the New Evangelization. Trained on the full depth of Catholic teaching, it doesn't improvise or compromise. It explains, illuminates, and defends the faith with clarity, reverence, patience, and compassion‚Äîto find the lost seeking the Way, to steady the shaken searching for the Truth, and to shine the Light in the darkness for the questioning.

## üöÄ Vision and Mission

Ex314.ai was created to:

- Provide accurate, faithful Catholic theological explanations
- Make the richness of Catholic teaching accessible to modern seekers
- Support the New Evangelization through cutting-edge technology
- Serve as a digital companion for spiritual growth and understanding
- Bring clarity to complex theological concepts without compromise

## üìö Training and Knowledge Base

Our LLM has been specifically fine-tuned on:

- The Catechism of the Catholic Church
- Code of Canon Law
- Vatican II Documents
- Church Fathers' writings
- Papal Encyclicals and Exhortations
- Summa Theologica and other scholastic works
- Modern Catholic theological texts
- Scripture with approved Catholic commentaries

This specialized training ensures the AI understands Catholic teaching in its proper context and can communicate it with both accuracy and pastoral sensitivity.

## üß† AI Philosophy

Ex314.ai is built with a distinct approach to AI:

1. **Faithful to the Magisterium**: The AI is designed to present Catholic teaching as taught by the Church, not to offer novel interpretations.

2. **Clear and Approachable**: Complex theology is explained in accessible language without reducing its depth.

3. **Pastorally Sensitive**: Responses balance doctrinal accuracy with compassion for those seeking understanding.

4. **Evangelically Oriented**: The AI aims to help those seeking truth to find it within Catholic teaching.

5. **Intellectually Rigorous**: Drawing on 2,000 years of Catholic intellectual tradition.
